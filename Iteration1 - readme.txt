Since this is the first iteration of the project, everything in this iteration is new material. The new materials take into account the programming design
principles tauaght in SYSC 2101. 



Known Issues:

	How does a task know who is trying to modify it?
	Should a chat system be implemented and how?
	Should State be its own class?
	Should application be a multi-user system?
	Since the application is based on the MVC design, we feel that we still don't have a view.


Roadmap Ahead:

	We plan to implement a GUI(view), JUnit testing, finish implementing methods and finish putting overall concept together
