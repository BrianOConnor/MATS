MATS

An application that a manager can use to keep track of projects and tasks an employee is working on. Gives employees an easy way to add and modify projects and tasks. This project was completed as part of a school project and uses a number of GoF design patterns as well as the MVC architecture.

I had this project up on SourceForge before but I've moved it here now, figured I might as well put it up.
