MATS (Multi-user Application Tracking System)

An application that a manager can use to keep track of projects and tasks an employee is working on. Gives employees an easy way to add and modify projects and tasks. This project was completed as part of a school project and uses a number of design patterns as well as the MVC architecture.

I contributed to this project as part of a team back in 2008. One of my team members uploaded the code and I forked the repository.
